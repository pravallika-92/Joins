DISCREPTION:
After receiving the first task, I realized the importance of having a solid understanding of Database Management Systems (DBMS). I started by exploring online learning platforms and decided to follow the DBMS lecture series available on YouTube from Unacademy. The instructors explained the fundamental concepts in a clear and structured manner, which helped me build a strong foundation in the subject.

The lectures covered a wide range of topics including the basics of databases, types of databases, data models, relational database concepts, keys, normalization, and ER diagrams. I made sure to take notes and practice each concept as it was introduced. This hands-on approach made it easier for me to retain the information and apply it later when working on the task.

In addition to the video lectures, I wanted to gain a deeper and more academic perspective on certain topics, particularly SQL joins. For this, I referred to the widely recommended textbook “Fundamentals of Database Systems” by Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant Navathe. The textbook explained the different types of joins—such as inner join, left outer join, right outer join, and full outer join—with diagrams and examples, making the concepts much clearer. Reading from a standard reference helped solidify my understanding of how data from multiple tables can be combined effectively using different join operations.

While learning, I also used ChatGPT to clear up any doubts or to get quick, simplified explanations of complex topics. ChatGPT was especially helpful in explaining differences between similar concepts, providing real-world analogies, and offering code snippets for better understanding. This allowed me to bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation efficiently.

To put the concepts into practice, I used MySQL Workbench as my development environment. It provided a user-friendly interface for writing, editing, and running SQL queries. I created sample databases, inserted data into tables, and experimented with various queries, especially joins. MySQL Workbench also allowed me to visualize the results in a structured format, which was very helpful while testing and debugging.

As part of documenting my work, I took clear and organized screenshots of outputs. These screenshots were then added to the README file in my GitHub repository for easy reference. The README file serves as both a guide and a demonstration of my learning process and outcomes.And i also copy pasted all my codes to the correspoing files save by the joint names. It shows the steps I followed, the tools I used, and the results I achieved during the course of this task.
